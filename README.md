# 🗽 Uber NYC Ride Data Analysis Project 📊
Welcome to my first data analysis project, where I explored Uber's ride data in New York City! This project dives into ride patterns, peak hours, and other fascinating insights to uncover hidden trends within the dataset.

📈 Project Overview
In this project, I used Uber's publicly available data to:

Analyze ride patterns throughout different times of the year.
Identify peak booking hours and how seasons affect ride demand.
Compare booking trends in summer vs. winter.
🔍 Key Insights
Maximum bookings occur during summer months.
Detailed analysis of time-based patterns, including morning and evening rush hours.
🛠️ Tools Used
This project was powered by the following Python libraries:

Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization to uncover patterns and trends.
🚀 What's Next?
This is the first of many data analysis projects to come! I'll be expanding into more complex analyses, predictive modeling, and deeper insights using new datasets. Stay tuned!
